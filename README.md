## use c++ to do something
There are many C + + codes of RSA, and many are written in advanced large database such as OpenSSL, but there are few RSA written in NTL large database. 
Therefore, this code is written in NTL, and a large number of ZZ class functions in NTL are used.

此代码有一些不足，本人也在持续改进当中。
目前密文是通过随机生成二进制的数字，本人想通过手动输入字符，再将char转化为二进制，最后解密的时候将二进制再转化为char
